            Home health services are offered to those who have difficulty or
            limitations in leaving their home to find or secure medical
            assistance. Skilled nursing, physical therapy, speech therapy,
            occupational therapy, or home health aides are all available. These
            services are provided to those who request home health assistance.
            All our home health patients will remain under a physician’s care,
            supervision, and observation.
